        bulletpoints:
          - "In addition to translation, I offer full proofreading (spelling, grammar and style) of Spanish originals and translations. Don’t let careless punctuation or odd-sounding calques ruin a good text. As we say in Spain, four eyes see more than two. And yes, I am that annoying friend who walks around pointing at street signs because 'there’s a missing comma!'"

        bulletpoints:
          - "Performing final checks on a localized product before its launch is essential to avoid a myriad of possible last minute errors."
          - "LQA is more technical and specific than proofreading, and it involves tasks such as checking style and clients guides, using specific software and implement last minute changes requested by the client. The process usually goes beyond the languages we speak, having to perform checks on tens of languages we don’t know. This is why LQA requires solid linguistic knowledge, as well as the skill of knowing where to look and what to look for."
