__Hi there! My name is Alba Vidal, audiovisual translator.__ “Audiovisual” and “Vidal” rhyme in Spanish, but sadly not in English. I will eventually come up with something nice to make up for it, I promise!

__I have over 7 years of experience as a professional translator and proofreader. Of those 7, 5 years have been dedicated almost exclusively to what I enjoy more than anything in the world: audiovisual translation.__

I remember being a pre-teen self translating Hilary Duff lyrics for fun. And I’m talking pre-internet times, so I used a physical dictionary! With pages! I also remember when __I was 18__ and had to choose what to study after high school, and how I would end up crying because __I couldn’t decide between English, Media Studies or Translation. Well, it turns out you can combine all three__, and that is what I’ve done.

After completing my BA in English Studies in Universidad de Oviedo (Spain), I moved to London, where I lived for several years. Among the many things I did there, I studied an __MA in Audiovisual Translation at the University of Roehampton__.

Fast forward to 2023, and __I have translated over 40 films and TV shows into Spanish__. In 2018, __I won an ATRAE award for Best Subtitled TV Show__ for my translation of RuPaul’s Drag Race.

Besides freelance translation, I have also worked as an in-house __Linguistic QA specialist for companies such as Electronic Arts and Deluxe Media__. I also collaborate with film festivals as a subtitle technician.
